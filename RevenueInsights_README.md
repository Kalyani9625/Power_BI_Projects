# Revenue Insights Dashboard for Hospitality Domain

• In my hands-on project, I took on the challenge of delving into revenue insights within the hospitality domain. The primary objective was to harness the power of historic data, unlocking valuable oportunities for revenue enhancement. 

• Developed an interactive dashboard that serves as a comprehensive tool for in-depth analysis that also enables the users to effortlessly navigate through various metrics and time frames to gain a holistic understanding of revenue dynamics. 

• The dashboard incorporates fundamental hospitality metrics, including ADR, RevPAR and advanced metrics such as DSRN, DBRN, DURN.

• The hands-on experience has deepened my understanding of revenue analytics, honing my skills in data visualization and strategic analysis within the dynmaic hospitality industry.
